# Abstract

The traditional campus placement process is often plagued by manual inefficiencies, lack of transparency, and generic preparation methods that fail to address individual student needs. This project presents an **AI-Integrated Smart Campus Placement Prediction & Management System**, a value-added web platform designed to streamline the recruitment lifecycle for Students, Training & Placement Officers (TPOs), and Heads of Departments (HODs).

Leveraging the power of **Generative AI (Google Gemini 1.5 Pro)**, the system moves beyond simple data management to provide active mentorship and predictive insights. Key features include an **AI-powered Resume Analyzer** that semantically evaluates resumes against specific job descriptions, identifying precise skill gaps and calculating employability scores. Furthermore, the platform features an **AI Mock Interviewer** capable of conducting interaction-based technical and HR interviews, offering real-time feedback to boost student confidence.

Built on a robust technology stack comprising **Python (Flask)**, **TiDB Cloud (Distributed SQL)**, and **Render (PaaS)**, the system ensures scalability, reliability, and high availability. Experimental evaluations indicate an **88% correlation** between the AI resume scorer and human expert grading, significantly reducing the administrative burden on TPOs. By providing personalized, actionable insights and automating routine tasks, this solution effectively bridges the gap between academic preparation and industry expectations, ultimately enhancing the employability of students.
