# 3. System Analysis

## 3.1 Existing System
The existing placement management process in most institutions is primarily manual or semi-automated, relying heavily on disparate tools such as Spreadsheets, Google Forms, and basic ERP modules.
*   **Manual Data Aggregation**: Placement officers (TPOs) manually collect student data (marks, resumes) via forms, leading to data redundancy and errors.
*   **Keyword-Based Filtering**: Traditional Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) filter resumes based on exact keyword matches. This often disqualifies capable students who may have used different terminology for the same skill (e.g., "ReactJS" vs. "Frontend Development").
*   **Lack of Feedback Mechanism**: When a student is rejected from a drive, they receive no constructive feedback. They remain unaware of their specific shortcomings (e.g., missing skills, poor resume formatting), leading to repeated failures.
*   **Fragmented Communication**: Information flows through WhatsApp groups or notice boards, causing crucial deadlines to be missed. HODs often lack real-time visibility into which of their students are placed.
*   **Generic Preparation**: Students practice with generic aptitude tests that do not align with the specific technical requirements of the visiting company.

## 3.2 Proposed System
The **AI-Integrated Smart Campus Placement Portal** addresses these limitations by automating administrative tasks and introducing an "Intelligence Layer" for student mentorship.
*   **Centralized Automation**: A unified platform where TPOs can post drives and HODs can verify students. The system automatically filters eligible students based on academic criteria (CGPA, Backlogs), eliminating manual sorting.
*   **Semantic AI Analysis**: Instead of simple keyword matching, the system uses **Generative AI (Gemini)** to understand the *context* of a resume. It evaluates a student's projects and experiences against the Job Description to provide a nuanced "Match Score."
*   **Actionable Feedback Loop**: Every student receives instant, personalized feedback. The AI highlights "Missing Skills" and suggests specific courses to bridge the gap *before* the interview.
*   **Interactive Mentorship**: The system includes an **AI Mock Interviewer** (Voice-enabled) and a **Coding Arena**. These tools simulate the actual recruitment process, allowing students to practice effectively in a low-stakes environment.
*   **Real-time Analytics**: HODs and TPOs have access to live dashboards showing placement statistics, helping them make data-driven decisions to improve department performance.
