# Tools and Technologies Used

## 2.3.1 Frontend Technologies
The frontend is responsible for the user interface and experience (UI/UX).
*   **HTML5 (HyperText Markup Language)**: Used for structuring the web pages. Semantic tags (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`) are used to improve accessibility and SEO.
*   **CSS3 (Cascading Style Sheets)**: Used for styling.
    *   **Glassmorphism Design**: A modern UI trend emphasizing widely used translucent backgrounds (frosted glass effect) and soft shadows.
    *   **Flexbox & Grid**: Utilized for responsive layouts that work across mobile and desktop devices.
*   **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Handles dynamic behavior, API calls (Fetch API), and client-side form validation.
*   **Three.js**: A 3D JavaScript library used to create the interactive, animated background on the login page, enhancing visual appeal.
*   **Jinja2 Templating**: The default templating engine for Flask, allowing dynamic data rendering directly within HTML files.

## 2.3.2 Backend Technologies
The backend handles the business logic, database interactions, and API endpoints.

**Python (Flask)** is used as the backend framework to develop RESTful APIs that handle core system operations such as user authentication, resume analysis, drive management, and notification triggering. The backend processes incoming requests, interacts with the AI engine (Gemini), applies business logic for eligibility filtering, and coordinates communication between the database, external AI services, and the frontend.

## 2.3.3 Database Technology
**TiDB Cloud (MySQL Compatible)** is used as the primary database for storing user profiles, resumes, drive details, and application statuses. Its distributed SQL architecture provides flexibility and scalability, allowing the system to handle high concurrency during placement drives efficiently. TiDB supports fast read and write operations, which is essential for real-time applications that require immediate feedback on applications and tests. The relational model ensures data integrity for critical academic records.

## 2.3.4 AI Integration and Event Processing
The "Intelligence Layer" is implemented using **Google Gemini API**. Real-time Resume Analysis is triggered when a student uploads a file. The text is parsed and evaluated against job descriptions using Generative AI.
*   **Event Listeners**: Used to trigger email notifications immediately when a student applies or when a TPO creates a drive.
*   **Scheduled Tasks**: Background workers can be configured to check for upcoming deadlines and send reminder alerts.
For communication, the system uses SMTP services to send "Offer Letters" and "Rejection Mails" generated by the AI. This ensures professional communication standards are maintained automatically.

## 2.3.5 Cloud Deployment and Hosting
The system is deployed using **Render**, which provides a managed cloud environment for hosting the web service. Render supports continuous deployment from GitHub, automatic SSL generation (HTTPS), and secure environment variable management. It simplifies cloud configuration and enables seamless scaling. Cloud deployment ensures high availability and consistent performance under varying user loads during placement season.

## 2.3.6 Security Technologies
Security is a critical aspect of the Smart Campus Placement Portal.
*   **Session-Based Authentication**: Secure http-only cookies are used to manage user sessions.
*   **Password Hashing**: **Bcrypt** (via Werkzeug) is used to hash passwords before storage, ensuring that even database administrators cannot view user passwords.
*   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Implemented to ensure that students cannot access TPO functions, and unverified students cannot access drive applications. This protects both user data and system integrity.
